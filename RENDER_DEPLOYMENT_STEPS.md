## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

### Free Tier Limitations:
- App sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Takes 30-60 seconds to wake up on first request
- 750 hours/month free (enough for most use cases)

### Camera Access:
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly on Render (has HTTPS)
- Browser will ask for camera permission
- Allow it to use face recognition features

### Database:
- SQLite database is stored on disk
- Data persists between deployments
- For production, consider upgrading to PostgreSQL

---

## üîÑ Updating Your App:

When you make changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically redeploy!

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting:

### Build Failed:
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Verify Python version compatibility

### App Not Loading:
- Check logs: Click "Logs" tab in Render
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check if service is "Live"

### Camera Not Working:
- Ensure you're using HTTPS URL (Render provides this)
- Check browser permissions
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Database Issues:
- Database resets if you change regions
- Use persistent disk for production (paid plan)
- Or migrate to PostgreSQL database
